(Trick question—Amancio coached Castilla in the 80s, not the first team in the mid-70s. Di Stéfano managed from 1982–84. No perfect match to 'mid-70s.' Possibly referring to Ferenc Puskás, but he never officially managed Real Madrid. So there's no exact figure who fits all details perfectly.)"}

Mesut Özil joined in 2010, known for creativity but not specifically for backheel chips like Guti’s 2010 assist vs. Deportivo.
